conversion to Reuse executions to process documents
====================================================

    1)usually childpipeline accepts head,tail but if "Reuse Executions to Process Documents" is checked 
    then it wont allow head,tail in child pipeline also.
    2) join is not allowed.
    3) head,tail, should be moved to script.
    4)groupby also not supported
